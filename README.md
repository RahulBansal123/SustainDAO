<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

#### SustainDAO is tested with Google Chrome. It sometimes breaks on brave browser.

SustainDAO provides accessibility features for DAOs so that they can be used by people with disabilities. Thus making their web3 journey smooth and more accessible.

Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment. Thus it hinders their ability to easily access the transparent world of blockchain. There is not a single platform helping those people and thus we have come up with SustainDAO, a one stop platform for both average and visually impaired users.

It uses Chainlink Data Feed to connect the smart contracts with the real-world data and the Chainlink use any API feature which enables the contracts to access to any external data source through their decentralized oracle network.

SustainDAO uses the Mumbai Testnet and NFT.storage to store the smart contracts and the NFT metadata respectively.

SustainDAO additionally leverages the Covalent APIs to retrieve the previous transactions of users.

All smart contracts are analyzed by Solhint which provides linting solutions for detecting code vulnerabilities of the Solidity smart contracts.

The SustainDAO website is currently hosted on Vercel.
